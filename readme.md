# Overview
This repository has implementation of various sorting algorithms, as well as some information related to them.

Sorting algorithms demonstration: [https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html)

 Sorting is the process of placing elements from a collection in some order. For example, a list of words could be sorted alphabetically or by length.
